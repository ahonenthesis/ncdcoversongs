This is a work-in-progress repository for the electronic appendix of my PhD thesis "Cover Song Identification Using Compression-based Distance Measures". I am trying to tidy up and document the codes, but there is still some work left to be done.

Currently, all the distance matrices for the evaluations in Chapters 5 & 6 are available in directory "results". Some code is still under cleaning, and some data files are likely not yet included in the repository. I will do my best to have everything ready (including decent readme and license files) by the end of 2015.

If you wish to run some evaluations before that, or you have something to ask about the code, please do not hesitate to contact me: teahonen@cs.helsinki.fi
