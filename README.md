This is a work-in-progress repository for the electronic appendix of my PhD thesis "Cover Song Identification Using Compression-based Distance Measures". I am tidying up and documenting the source codes, but there is still some work left to be done. I am also building a more convenient wrapper/ framework for the codes, and it will be available before my dissertation on April 2016. Currently, running the experiments might need a little guidance. If you wish to run some experiments but are not sure how to, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Currently, all experiments of the thesis should be reproducable with this code, and all data and result files should be present. If you notice something missing, please let me know.
