This is a work-in-progress repository for the electronic appendix of my PhD thesis "Cover Song Identification Using Compression-based Distance Measures". I am tidying up and documenting the source codes, but there is still some work left to be done. I am also building a more convenient wrapper/ framework for the system. At the moment, you can still reproduce all the experiments of my thesis. See exampleRun.m for an example of how to conduct an experiment.

Currently, all experiments of the thesis should be reproducable with this code, and all data and result files should be present. If you notice something missing, please let me know.
